### Insights from the data
We've explored some of the datasets from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).  
First, we looked at relation between inflation and interest rate. It is known that interest rates and inflation are intrinsically linked: central banks often raise interest rates to curb rising inflation by making borrowing more expensive, which cools down the economy and reduces demand, ultimately lowering inflation.

And indeed we can see that trend in the actual data:

Next, we looked at unemployment rate in US by state. The interactive chart reveals that Nevada experienced the highest unemployment during COVID:

Last visual was the unemployment rate by sex:

We can see that although normally unemployment rate is similar for men and women, women experienced higher unemployment rate during COVID.
